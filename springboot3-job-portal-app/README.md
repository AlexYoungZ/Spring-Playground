**Build a job application platform with Spring MVC, Thymeleaf, Spring Security, JPA, Hibernate and MySQL**

The project aims to build a job application platform where recruiters can post jobs, manage their profiles, and view applications, while candidates can search for jobs, apply, and manage their profiles. The backend will leverage Spring MVC for handling web requests, Thymeleaf for rendering views, Spring Security for securing the application, and JPA/Hibernate for database interactions with MySQL.

* Allow recruiters to create and post job openings, view all job listings and the candidates who have applied, creating and managing their profiles.

* Allow candidates to apply for job postings, provide a search dashboard for candidates to find job postings and view job details, to create and manage their profiles, including uploading resumes.

* Create database entities like company, job post, recruiter profile, skills, user, candidate profile. Using JPA/Hibernate for relational data mapping, data is stored with MySQL database.

* Implement Spring Security to support custom authentication and authorization for user registration and login/logout, integrated into dashboard.

* Use Thymeleaf templates for server-side rendering of web pages and utilize WebJars for managing client-side web libraries.
